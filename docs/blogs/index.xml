      <description>Hi There!
The commits conventions are very useful when trying to explain to a group of developers (maybe colleagues) about your changes. In the Code Review the implicit explanation of your changes is a powerful tool for their understanding and probably an advantage because you can complement your changes with your explanation, so that means you need a less time to explain and improves the understanding of the case to his colleagues.</description>

How should I start?
You start to learn something new, challenge yourself, and seek mastery, then you realize that the horizon of knowledge expands, and you evaluate if you want to continue.
Choose a new path. You order goals and objectives, conclude your priorities and make a decision.
Do you feel sure of what you know? You teach, share and collaborate in expanding the horizon of knowledge.</description>
